This repo contains data processing and visualization for data from the MLA platform. See https://github.com/Coul33t/MLA-motion-processing for the motion processing part.
Needs:
* Python 3.6 (64 bits)
* Scipy 1.0.0
* Numpy 1.14.2
* sklearn 0.19.1
* matplotlib 2.2.0

A lot of the code is still being tested and changed, and manipulations require to directly modify the code, don't expect anything convenient to use anytime soon.
